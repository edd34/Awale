Here is a C# implementation of the famous game "Mraha Wa Tso", which is basically the Awale Game as played in Mayotte.
Here is the reference for implemementing the rules : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V8d60Dq3CA.
Feel free to collaborate.
First I am implementing the game's core then I will try to implement this one with the Unity Game Engine !

The Game is actually playable, the network features works well but there is actually a little bug : the possible moves aren't shown !

To play the game : search in the folder bin/debug/ and double click the exe app.
If you are using *NIX os, you have to install mono dependencies (just install the mono develop IDE) and open a terminal, navigate in the folder of the bin debug and hit "Mono Awale_Console.exe" and that is all !
